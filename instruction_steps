#Test steps check list:
1. Workstation 1  to Development Network
   Workstation 2  to Production Network (final demo will be used)

2. create workspace
    see deomo.sh 
3. setup for AMR MiR100
    3.1 see deomo.sh
    3.2 To control the MiR100, use the provided tablet and connect into the Wifi SSID "MIR_1442", go to the browser and enter "mir.com".
    We will provide the credentials. 
3. Waypoints and trafic edit
   # source path to run 
   . /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
   . ~/rmf_demos_ws/install/setup.bash
   . ~/ncs_ws/install/setup.bash
   # For Traffic Editor
    traffic-editor ~/ncs_ws/src/chart/chart_maps/maps/chart.project.yaml

    # For Gazebo Simulation
    ros2 launch chart_launch scenario_sim.launch.xml
    # For Production Networks
    ros2 launch chart_launch scenario_hardware.launch.xml
4. Compute Map Transform
   setup the 4 defined waypoins(rviz) and the corresponding points in navigation to init the Nudged Transformer
5. Functionality Tests
    test  test_door_request.py test_loop_request.py, test_lift_request.py in command line: 
    . /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
    . ~/rmf_demos_ws/install/setup.bash
    . ~/ncs_ws/install/setup.bash
    ros2 launch chart_launch scenario_sim.launch.xml or ros2 launch chart_launch scenario_hardware.launch.xml 
    python3 PATH_TO_test_[test_name].py
6. Deconflict test with the AMRs, commmanded by above setup workspace
